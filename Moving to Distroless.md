# Moving to Distroless from Alpine

This document is my experience of moving my application from an Alpine base image to a "distroless" image. 

As described in their git hub repo - `"Distroless" images contain only your application and its runtime dependencies. They do not contain package managers, shells or any other programs you would expect to find in a standard Linux distribution. `
